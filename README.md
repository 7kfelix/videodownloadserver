<h1>
    About the Project
</h1>

A simple Python project using tkinter, threading and yt dlp to create a server to download videos from Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram and others.


This project can save videos in mp4 and mp3 formats, and you can choose the quality as “high”, “medium” and “low”. I will update the quality to 1080p format and others, but not only that, I will update and correct some possible errors.

It's a simple project just to learn about some libraries and tkinter, don't take it too seriously.

Possible updates: video history, audio and video separation function and video player within the program.
